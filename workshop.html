      <h1 class="project-title">Group Workshop</h1>
      <h2>I led a group workshop to brainstorm feature ideas and improvements for the Center for Academic Innovation's website, Problem Roulette.</h2>
      <p>As a User Experience Research Fellow at the University of Michigan's Center for Academic Innovation, one of my favorite projects was leading a group workshop. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to plan and facilitate an hour long workshop where I got to learn from and brainstorm with a group of my peers.</p>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the workshop was to brainstorm feature ideas and improvements for the Center's website, Problem Roulette. Problem Roulette is a tool that students can use to practice past exam problems for a class. They can select topics and work their way through a randomized set of problems. </p>
      <p>Problem Roulette also has a Group Study Mode feature where students can invite their friends through email, and then multiple students can work on the same set of problems together. </p>
      <p>This Group Study Mode was in its first year of being on the live website. As the software team prepared to head into their next development cycle, they were hoping to gather feedback about the group mode so that Group Study Mode 2.0 could be a part of the future development.</p>
      <h3>Research Goals and Questions</h3>
      <p>After an initial meeting with the UX designers and developers, my fellow UX Research intern and I defined a set of research goals and questions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify what people like about / have issues with in the current Group Study mode</li>
        <li>Figure out what we should add to Group Study Mode 2.0</li>
        <li>Why are students not using Group Study Mode? Would a different way of presenting it make them more likely to use it?</li>
        <li>When would students be most likely to use Group Study Mode in the semester?​​​​​​​</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Selecting a Research Method</h3>
      <p>This project was open-ended; it was up to us to determine an appropriate research method. We'd already conducted some guerrilla testing throughout the summer, where we traveled around campus and asked students if they'd be willing to chat with us for a few minutes. That had been effective for gathering quick feedback and insights into a very specific feature or two; however, this was a broader task that we wanted to delve into deeply.</p>
      <p>We decided to hold a workshop because we wanted to have a creative setting that would inspire conversation. Additionally, we realized that we had a great resource in the office: all of the summer interns! We often found ourselves doing hallway testing or asking the other interns for their input on things, and because our target population was students, it was a perfect scenario! ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</p>
      <h3>The Workshop</h3>
      <p>We invited 10 Summer Fellows join us in our large conference room, where we went through a Group Study Mode session together, having the fellows write down feedback on sticky notes throughout the session. Their notes corresponded to prompts that we had hung up on three large sheets on the conference room walls. We then had a discussion that focused on the fellows' group study preferences, their likes, dislikes, and suggestions about the current Group Study Mode format, and their thoughts on how to make the tool more engaging. </p>
      <p>Following the workshop, my UX Research partner and I used affinity mapping to further categorize the feedback. We listed how many notes corresponded to each theme to help emphasize the significance of the suggestions.</p>
      <h3>Biggest Takeaways</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The participants disliked having to study/do questions simultaneously and wait to proceed. One suggestion is to allow students to work through a set number of questions at their own pace, and then wait at the end to see the correct/wrong questions across the group. (8 notes)</li>
        <li>Participants liked the chat feature (6 notes)</li>
        <li>Improving Engagement through Discussion - Encouraging discussion, either through additional prompts (options for wanting discussion/no discussion quick quiz mode) or through making the chat a more prominent and embedded part of the page "don't hide chat, make it clear and visible so it doesn't block things and also has everyone see it" "noting which questions were being answered when in the chat might be helpful" (5 notes)</li>
        <li>Suggestion of having "open groups" to join - similar to a game server, allow students to randomly join groups with other students who are online (5 notes) ​​​​​​​</li>
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>Doing a workshop was a really fun way to bring a group of the fellows together while at work! And it was also a great and easy way to get feedback from students from a variety of backgrounds and experiences; we had UX, development, product management, and learning experience design fellows all contributing their ideas.</p>
